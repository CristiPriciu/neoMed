# neoMed

This is my first project in ASP.NET. It could use some more polish but for now its functional, Front & Back End, SQL, all work.

If you are somewhat skilled in SQL, neoMed DB.SQL can be use to restore the data base. If not, just imagine it and look at ASP and C#

Thank you for checking out this project and GitHub account!
